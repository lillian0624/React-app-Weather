# React Weather Forecast App

## Overview

I developed a weather forecasting web application using React that allows users to input a city name,
and the app displays the current weather data, temperature, and a 5-day weather forecast for that city.
The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

# React App Weather

This project is a simple weather application built with React. It allows users to search for the current weather in any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

- Search for current weather by city name
- Displays temperature, weather description, and weather icon
- Responsive and easy to use interface

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides real-time weather data
- **Create React App**: Project scaffolding and build scripts
- **Font Awesome**: For icons (if used in the UI)

## Features

- Users can input a city name to get weather information.
- The app uses Axios to make API requests to OpenWeatherMap.
- The current weather and 5-day forecast data are displayed separately.
- The city-state is managed in the App.js component, and it updates when a new city is submitted.
- User input is cleared after submission for a better user experience.
- Error handling is included in case of API request failures.
- Responsive design for optimal usability and appeal on various devices and screens.
- Weather-related icons make the app more informative.

## Improvements and Considerations:

- Implement further styling and design to enhance the user interface.
- Consider incorporating user geolocation to detect the user's location automatically.
