# React Weather Forecast App

## Overview

I developed a weather forecasting web application using React that allows users to input a city name, 
and the app displays the current weather data, temperature, and a 5-day weather forecast for that city. 
The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

## Features

- Users can input a city name to get weather information.
- The app uses Axios to make API requests to OpenWeatherMap.
- The current weather and 5-day forecast data are displayed separately.
- The city-state is managed in the App.js component, and it updates when a new city is submitted.
- User input is cleared after submission for a better user experience.
- Error handling is included in case of API request failures.
- Responsive design for optimal usability and appeal on various devices and screens.

  
## Improvements and Considerations:

- Implement further styling and design to enhance the user interface.
- Add more weather-related information and icons to make the app more informative.
- Consider incorporating user geolocation to detect the user's location automatically.
- Implement responsive design for better usability on different devices.
